Demo - Analyzing web vulnerabilities using LLMs and AI

Demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can accelerate web vulnerability detection and analysis with the help of Artificial Intelligence, integrating an intentionally vulnerable server, a log database, and an LLM service into a test environment. The goal is to showcase how natural language processing capabilities enable data correlation, identification of suspicious patterns, and real-time mitigation or investigation suggestions, thereby optimizing response and decision-making in cybersecurity.
